### Scope:
    
    MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT MVP

    1. Gather CSV files and data 
    2. EDA exploratory  data Analysis 
    3. Transfer Data to SSMS for further exploration  and data wrangling.
    4. remove nulls and choose the exact data needed for data prep
    4. Start data prep and model pipeline
    5. Further explore data to find trends
  

    If time permits 
    
    6. Create Azure Data Factory ETL
    7. Create Dashboard to display results  

    Still deciding  on which  data set to use.
