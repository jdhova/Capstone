### PROJECT-STATUS : IN PROGRESS



### Objecttive:

    The Banking and financial system is one the most lucrative sectors in Canada,
    However, this sector is also hit my lots of fraudulent  activities with losses hitting the Bank and Insurance companies. 
    This Model will be:
    
    1.  Predicting if a credit card transaction is either fraudulent  or not based on transaction.

    2.  Observing recurring fraudulent  transaction trends.

    3.  Based on similar trends I will be creating a dashboard and solution 
        which will minimize the obvious recurring fraudulent transactions.


  
    
### Scope:
    
    MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT MVP

    1. Gather CSV files and data 
    2. EDA exploratory  data Analysis 
    3. Transfer Data to SSMS for further exploration  and data wrangling.
    4. remove nulls and choose the exact data needed for data prep
    4. Start data prep and model pipeline
    5. Further explore data to find trends
  

    If time permits 
    
    6. Create Azure Data Factory ETL
    7. Create Dashboard to display results  

    Still deciding  on which  data set to use.
